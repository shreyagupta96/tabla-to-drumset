# Tabla Folder - Classify Tabla Notes & Generate Next Tabla Notes

This folder contains WAV files for tabla sounds used by tabla-related functionalities.

## Purpose

When you click these buttons, the application will look for audio files in this `tabla` folder:
- **"ðŸŽµ Classify Tabla Notes"** - plays classification results with tabla sounds
- **"ðŸ”® Generate Next Tabla Notes"** - plays generated notes with tabla sounds

## Test Audio Files Needed:

For testing the mock responses, you need these WAV files:

**For Classify functionality:**
1. Tin.wav - Traditional tabla Tin sound
2. Ta.wav - Traditional tabla Ta sound  
3. Dhin.wav - Traditional tabla Dhin sound
4. Na.wav - Traditional tabla Na sound

**For Generate functionality (additional files needed):**
5. Dha.wav - Traditional tabla Dha sound
6. Ghe.wav - Traditional tabla Ghe sound

## Mock Response Sequences:

**Classify Tabla Notes mock response:**
- Tin, Tin, Ta, Dhin, Na, Dhin, Na (8 notes)

You can use traditional tabla recordings or synthesized tabla sounds.

This allows you to have different audio representations for the same note names!
